Castopod is built on top of [CodeIgniter4](https://codeigniter.com/), a PHP
framework that encourages
[good security practices](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/concepts/security.html).

To maximize your instance's safety and prevent any malicious attack, we
recommend you update all your Castopod files permissions after installation or
updates (to avoid any prior permission error):

- `writable/` folder must be **readable** and **writable**.
- `public/media/` folder must be **readable** and **writable**.
- any other file must be set to **readonly**.

For instance, if you are using Apache or NGINX with Ubuntu you may do the
following:

```bash
sudo chown -R root:root /path/to/castopod
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/castopod/writable
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/castopod/public/media
```

## Third-party Plugins

<Aside type="caution" title="Disclaimer">
  Installing untrusted third-party plugins on Castopod carries inherent security
  risks, such as unauthorized access to sensitive user data, data breaches, data
  tampering, and injecting malicious code.
</Aside>

Since v2's [Plugins Architecture](../../plugins), Castopod can be extended with
all sorts of cool features. Anyone can choose to create their own plugins and
even share them with the community.

ðŸ‘‰ Plugins are a way to inject code in parts of Castopod through
[Hooks](../../plugins/hooks).

Now, if you create your own plugin and install it in your own Castopod, that
means you control both the code that gets injected and the environment: all is
good!

But as for **third-party plugins**, you must treat them as a **potential
security risk _by default_**:

1. Make sure you **trust the source before installing any third-party plugin**
2. **Review the plugin's code** yourself if you can or
   [ask developers from the community for help](https://castopod.org/chat)
