title: Authentication & Authorization
---

Castopod handles authentication and authorization using `codeigniter/shield`
coupled with custom rules. Roles and permissions are defined at two levels:

1. [instance wide](#1-instance-wide-roles-and-permissions)
2. [per podcast](#2-per-podcast-roles-and-permissions)
